# Getting Started: Initializing Your Project

To get started with your new project, you can use the provided initialization scripts. Depending on your operating system, you can use either `ProjectInit.bat` for Windows or `ProjectInit.sh` for Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS).

## Windows

* Open a Command Prompt.
* Navigate to the directory where `ProjectInit.bat` is located.
* Run the script by typing:
```bat
ProjectInit.bat
```
* Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initialization.

## Unix-based Systems (Linux, macOS)

* Open a terminal.
* Navigate to the directory where `ProjectInit.sh` is located.
* Make the script executable (if it is not already) by running:
```sh
chmod +x ProjectInit.sh
```
* Run the script by typing:
```sh
./ProjectInit.sh
```
* Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initialization.

Once the initialization is complete, your project will be set up and ready for development. Happy coding!
